      <!-- Your bio page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person. -->

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Manchester UK, I have a variety of hobbies and interests outside of work</p>
      </section>
      <!--Pole-->
      <article>
        <h3>Pole Fitness</h3>
        <img src="./Pole.jpg" alt="Me upside down on a pole">
        <p>I always like to start with my wildcard interest, I've been an avid poler on and off for years, to me its the most fun way to exercise, it has a great feeling of progression. Learning new moves really scratches that itch of achieving something.</p>

      <!--Video Games-->

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <img src="./tft.png" alt="That one time I was in the top 1% of a video game">
        <p>Like a lot of people I enjoy playing video games, some I'm good at some I'm not. I usually enjoy playing with friends, I love the teamwork and camaraderie that comes along with that. Probably my highest gaming accolade is reaching top 1% in Teamfight Tactics (TFT)</p>
        <h4>Other games I enjoy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
          <li>Dota 2</li>
          <li>Elden Ring</li>
          <li>Rouge Squadron</li>

      <!--Rock Climbing-->
      <article>
        <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
        <img src="./Rock.jpg" alt="Climbing up an indoor rock climbing wall">
        <p>I started rock climbing a few years after pole when I moved to an area without a pole studio. It seemed like a great way to keep the grip strength and learn a new skill. I have yet to do any outdoor climbs but its definitely on the cards for next summer </p>
